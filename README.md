# Flights Dashboard

A dashboard service for displaying flights, airports and aircompanies data. This project is based on the data available on Kaggle through the following link: [2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?ref=hackernoon.com&select=airports.csv).

## Useful Resources
