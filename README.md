# Flights Dashboard

A dashboard service for displaying flights, airports and aircompanies data. This project is based on the data available on Kaggle through the following link: [2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?ref=hackernoon.com&select=airports.csv).

## Useful Resources

A list of useful resources that helped me throughout the project.

- [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history.
- [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/) - A *Digital Garden* created by Lyz with contributions. There's a section on [FastAPI](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/fastapi/). But checkout the other sections for a really nice content.
